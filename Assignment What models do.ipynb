But the disadvantage of adding many features to a model that we would need to experiment all the feature and we would get lots of information which are not useful. I think best way to design the model is using the useful and relevant features to design model.  "

    "It is Interesting that the subject recommendations system does not include demographic information (such as age or gender) as part of the decision making process. I think not to consider the age, gender and location can be a bias for recommendations systems because people based on age, gender and location may have various preferences. Also, many people chose the movie to watch based on their favorite director, screenwriter or actor/actoress so I suggest that these should be included in the Netflix's recommendation system. \n"
