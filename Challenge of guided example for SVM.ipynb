    "Firstly the overfit is a problem, even though it was poor in the first place. We could go back and clean up our feature set. There might be some gains to be made by getting rid of the noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could take our regression problem and turn it into a classifier. With this number of features and a discontinuous outcome, we might have better luck thinking of this as a classification problem. We could make it simpler still by instead of classifying on each possible value, group reviews to some decided high and low values. And that is your challenge.\n",

    "Transform this regression problem into a binary classifier and clean up the feature set. You can choose whether or not to include nutritional information, but try to cut your feature set down to the 30 most valuable features.\n",

    "When you've finished that, also take a moment to think about bias. Is there anything in this dataset that makes you think it could be biased, perhaps extremely so?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is. Several things in fact, but most glaringly is that we don't actually have a random sample. It could be, and probably is, that the people more likely to choose some kinds of recipes are more likely to give high reviews.\n",
